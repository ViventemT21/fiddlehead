	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Clue 12</h1>
	<p>I am most commonly seen in autumn.  I am too tiny to be edible and I am an excellent decomposer. I can survive a journey through the digestive tracts of animals like horses and cows which is why I often pop up in animal dung. I launch my "eggs'' like a cannonball through the air to reproduce. When I grow in mulch, you can see me fruiting in fairy rings. My fruiting body gives me my common name. Who am I? <br><br>
	<b>On finding the post, answer the following question:</b><br>
     Name the small capsule of spores, which splashes out when raindrops fall into the cup. <br>
