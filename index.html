	<h1>Clue 12</h1>
	<p>I am most commonly seen in autumn.  I am too tiny to be edible and I am an excellent decomposer. I can survive a journey through the digestive tracts of animals like horses and cows which is why I often pop up in animal dung. I launch my "eggs'' like a cannonball through the air to reproduce. When I grow in mulch, you can see me fruiting in fairy rings. My fruiting body gives me my common name. Who am I? <br><br>
	<b>On finding the post, answer the following question:</b><br>
     Name the small capsule of spores, which splashes out when raindrops fall into the cup. <br>
     The answer to this question will be the key to the next clue and will be present in the post. Enter this key as the password to the PDF named “Clue 13 - Round 4” sent on the WhatsApp group to get the next clue. <br>
      The key should be in lowercase and should not include any blank spaces, even if it contains multiple words. </p>
